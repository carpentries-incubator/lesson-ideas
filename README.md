# lesson-ideas
Repo to capture ideas about new Data Carpentry lessons or new versions of existing lessons.

If you have ideas about lessons that you'd like to see developed, or you have already developed some material that you think could be a start to a lesson, start an issue in this repo, or add to an existing discussion!
